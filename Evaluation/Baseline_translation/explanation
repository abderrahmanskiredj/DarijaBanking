As a baseline, we just train an english intent classifier by fine-tuning Bert. Then, when we receive a user query in Arabic or in Darija, we just translate it to english using seamlessm4t translation model and then classify it using this Bert Intent Classifier.
In this folder we have 2 notebooks:
- seamless.ipynb to translate the test data from darija/arabic to english
- base_line_bert_with_translation.ipynb to evaluate this baseline
